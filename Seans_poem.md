# This is Just to Say

I have hot-coded
the servers
that were in
the cloud

and which
you were probably
hoping
to push to production

Forgive me
they were disastrous
so buggy
and so patchy



#Server shanty

There once was a server named dev
built by those who drank coffee for bev
who discovered a hack
that set them far back:
crypto farmers had made the fans rev.
