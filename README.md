# Poetry Git Tutorial
This is a poetry git tutorial that is inspired by the [CodingTraining/Rainbow-Poem](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Poem) resource and the underlying Git Training for poetry course series by [Daniel Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/).

In this repo I will collaborate on poems with other people in order to train them (and myself) on the best way to use the Github workflow. 
As you interact with this repo, expect that you will experience the enforcement of arbitrary "Poetry Rules" that are meant to illustrate the kind of rules that we might have for constraining code or documentation. 

Generally, this repo will excercise some of the concepts from [CareSets](https://careset.com) advanced Github Training. And I am storing this on my personal repo, so that I can make issues here and not clutter up anyone actual ticket queue for CareSet work!!

This is a public repo, so all contributors should keep their poems PG-13 or under (limericks are ok, but perhaps not *naughty* limericks). And *be aware* that our conversations, issue, pull reviews, etc etc, are world-readable. 

To start, please read the [Instructions](Instructions.md)
